Welcome to the Library Management System, a full-featured web application developed using the MERN stack. This platform provides users with a dynamic and interactive way to explore a vast collection of books. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily sign up, log in, and browse through different categories of books tailored to your interests.

Once logged in, you have the option to read books directly on the platform or save them to your personal library for later reading. The application is designed to offer a seamless reading experience, whether you're looking to dive into a new book immediately or curate a list of favorites for future enjoyment.

For the purposes of this demonstration, the site also includes an admin panel. This exclusive feature is available only during the demo and is not accessible to regular users. The admin panel allows administrators to manage the book collection, including adding new titles or removing existing ones. This feature showcases the platform's scalability and ease of content management. Please note that in a production environment, access to the admin panel would be restricted to authorized personnel only.

The demo is currently not responsive for mobile devices and a PC is recommended for viewing it.
