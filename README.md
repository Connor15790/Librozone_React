This is a Library Management System built with the MERN stack, offering a seamless user experience through a React-based web application. Users can sign up, log in, and explore a wide range of books categorized by genre. The platform allows users to either read books instantly or save them for later.

For demonstration purposes, the site includes an admin panel accessible only during the demo phase. This panel enables administrators to add or remove books from the collection. Please note that regular users will not have access to the admin panel.
